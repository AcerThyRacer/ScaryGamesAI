# Hellaphobia: 10-Phase 2D Dungeon Horror Remaster Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines a MASSIVE 10-phase overhaul to transform **Hellaphobia** into a terrifying, 2D side-scrolling psychological horror dungeon crawler. Inspired by classic 2D platformers (like Mario or Castlevania) but deeply infused with psychological dread, stalker enemies, and grotesque boss fights.

The core loop: Explore interconnected 2D dungeon rooms, manage your sanity, hide from terrifying entities, solve puzzles, and survive intense boss encounters.

---

### Phase 1: 2D Dungeon Core & Room Navigation
**Objective:** Establish the foundational "Mario-style" 2D side-scrolling movement and room-by-room dungeon traversal.
*   **Mechanics:** Precise 2D jumping, walking, and crouching.
*   **Room Transitions:** Moving to the edge of the screen or entering doors transitions the player to new, discrete "parts" of the dungeon (Zelda/Mario style screen transitions).
*   **Atmosphere:** Deep darkness, brick/stone dungeon tilesets, and a claustrophobic camera angle.

### Phase 2: Core Psychological Horror Systems
**Objective:** Introduce the mechanics that will mess with the player's mind.
*   **Sanity Meter:** Drops when in the dark or looking at horrifying things.
*   **Hallucinations:** Fake platforms, ghostly figures that disappear when approached.
*   **Lighting System:** A dynamic flashlight/lantern system where shadows cast realistically in 2D space. Everything outside the light is pitch black.

### Phase 3: Creepy Enemy AI & Stalker Mechanics
**Objective:** Populate the dungeon with terrifying entities that require stealth and evasion.
*   **Stalkers:** Invincible enemies that slowly pursue the player across different rooms.
*   **Hiding:** Mechanics to hide in the background (lockers, shadows, alcoves).
*   **Jump Scares:** Scripted and procedural scares based on the player's sanity level and movement patterns.

### Phase 4: Dungeon Progression & Puzzles
**Objective:** Give the player reasons to explore the terrifying environment.
*   **Locked Doors & Keys:** Metroidvania-lite progression. Find rusted keys to open deep dungeon sectors.
*   **Lore Notes:** Blood-stained notes that provide backstory and hint at puzzle solutions.
*   **Environmental Puzzles:** Pulling levers in the dark, stepping on pressure plates, moving crates to reach high platforms.

### Phase 5: Mini-Boss Encounters
**Objective:** Introduce intense, claustrophobic combat/evasion arenas.
*   **Arena Lock-in:** Doors slam shut, locking the player in a 2D room with a monstrosity.
*   **Mechanics:** Bosses require puzzle-solving or exploiting environment traps to defeat/escape, rather than direct combat.
*   **First Major Threat:** "The Warden" - a massive, lumbering dungeon keeper.

### Phase 6: Advanced Platforming Hazards
**Objective:** Make the environment as dangerous as the monsters.
*   **Hazards:** Rusty spikes, crumbling floors, swinging pendulums, and bottomless pits.
*   **Sanity Traps:** Platforming sections that change or become more difficult if the player's sanity is low (e.g., spikes that only appear when insane).
*   **Verticality:** Deep shafts and tall towers requiring precise platforming under pressure.

### Phase 7: Inventory & Survival Mechanics
**Objective:** Add resource management to increase tension.
*   **Resources:** Flashlight batteries (light), Sanity Pills (mental health), and Bandages (physical health).
*   **Inventory UI:** A minimalist, non-intrusive inventory system.
*   **Scarcity:** Items are rare, forcing players to make tough choices (e.g., run in the dark to save battery, but lose sanity).

### Phase 8: Major Boss Fights & Cinematic Scares
**Objective:** Implement massive, multi-stage boss fights and high-octane chase sequences.
*   **Giant Grotesque Bosses:** Screen-filling terrors that require dodging complex attack patterns.
*   **Chase Sequences:** Auto-scrolling sections where the player must perfectly platform to outrun an instant-kill entity.
*   **Phases:** Bosses have distinct phases, becoming more aggressive and changing the room layout.

### Phase 9: Audio Design & Ambience
**Objective:** Perfect the auditory psychological horror.
*   **Dynamic Ambience:** Complete silence broken by dripping water, distant chains, and agonizing screams.
*   **Player Feedback:** Heavy breathing, heartbeats that speed up near enemies, and whispers when sanity is low.
*   **Spatial Audio:** 2D directional audio so players can hear *which room* a monster is in.

### Phase 10: Polish, Visual Effects, & True Endings
**Objective:** Finalize the game with mind-bending effects and narrative payoff.
*   **Screen Effects:** VHS tracking glitches, CRT scanlines, and screen-tearing during intense scares.
*   **Performance:** Optimization for smooth 60fps 2D platforming.
*   **Multiple Endings:** Outcomes based on how much sanity was preserved, how many secrets were found, and which bosses were defeated.
