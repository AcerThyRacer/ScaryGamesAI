  subs.claimLoyaltyReward(3); // 3-month reward
}
```

## How to Integrate Phase 26 (Advertising):

```javascript
import { getAdvertisingSystem } from './core/advertising-system.js';

const ads = getAdvertisingSystem({ adFreeForPremium: true });
await ads.initialize();

// Show rewarded video (user-initiated)
const reward = { type: 'gems', amount: 100 };
const result = await ads.showRewardedVideo('store_bonus', reward);

if (result.completed) {
  console.log('Reward granted!');
}

// Show interstitial (between games)
if (ads.canShowAd('interstitial').allowed) {
  await ads.showInterstitial('post_game');
}

// Track affiliate sale
ads.trackAffiliateSale('STREAMER_CODE', 29.99);

const revenue = ads.calculatePartnershipRevenue(startDate, endDate);
console.log(`Total partnership revenue: $${revenue.total}`);
```

## How to Integrate Phase 27 (Viral Marketing):

// Create and share clip
const clip = viral.createClip({ type: 'manual', duration: 30 });
viral.shareClip(clip.id, 'tiktok');

// Send referral invite
viral.sendReferralInvite('friend@email.com', 'Join me!');

// Redeem referral code
const result = viral.redeemReferralCode('HORROR123', newUserId);

// Schedule content
viral.createDevBlog('Phase 29 Preview', 'Coming soon...', ['devlog', 'preview']);
```

# 📝 TECHNICAL NOTES

## Payment Processing:
- **Stripe**: Primary processor (cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
- **PayPal**: Alternative for international users
- **Crypto**: Consider for Founder's Pack (Bitcoin, ETH)
- **Compliance**: PCI-DSS Level 1 certified

## Ad Compliance:
- **COPPA**: No targeted ads to under-13 users
- **GDPR**: Explicit consent required for EU users
- **CCPA**: Opt-out mechanism for California users
- **Frequency Caps**: Enforced server-side to prevent abuse

## Community Safety:
- **Auto-Moderation**: AI-powered content filtering
- **Human Review**: Escalation for edge cases
- **Appeals Process**: Fair review within 48 hours
- **Transparency**: Quarterly reports published

## Known Limitations:

1. **Subscriptions**: Requires backend billing integration (not client-side only)
2. **Advertising**: Ad networks require approval process
3. **Viral**: K-factor depends on product quality (can't force virality)
4. **Community**: Requires dedicated human moderators (automation helps but doesn't replace)

# 🎉 CONCLUSION

Phases 25-28 have successfully delivered **4 comprehensive monetization and growth systems** that ensure ScaryGamesAI is financially sustainable and primed for viral expansion:

**Subscription Evolution:** Four-tier model with maximum value extraction and retention  
**Advertising & Partnerships:** Diversified revenue streams that respect user experience  
**Viral Marketing Machine:** Built-in growth engine targeting K-factor >1.2  
**Community Building Empire:** Passionate, engaged community driving organic advocacy

**Combined Impact:**
