# Archived Roadmap Documentation

This directory contains historical roadmap completion summaries that have been archived to reduce confusion and maintain a single source of truth.

## Archive Date
February 19, 2026

## Reason for Archival
These files contained contradictory completion status claims (ranging from 10% to 100% complete) which created confusion about actual project status. The `2026_ULTIMATE_ROADMAP_STATUS.md` file in the root directory now serves as the single source of truth for roadmap progress.
